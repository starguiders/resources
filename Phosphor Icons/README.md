# Phosphor Icons

An icon font, hosted by me for more convenience.

<!-- BEGIN_OVERVIEW -->
Phosphor is a flexible icon family for interfaces, diagrams, presentations — whatever, really.

- 1,248 icons and counting
- 6 weights: **Thin**, **Light**, **Regular**, **Bold**, **Fill**, and **Duotone**
- Designed at 16 x 16px to read well small and scale up big
- Raw stroke information retained to fine-tune the style

More ways to use these icons at [phosphoricons.com](https://phosphoricons.com).

# Usage

* add the stylesheet to your html page before the end of head with: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://starguiders.github.io/resources/Phosphor Icons/PhosphorIcons.css"/>`
* add an icon: `<i class="ph-light ph-anchor"></i>`, substituting after the first ph- to change the weight name (removing -light to make it a regular icon) substituting after the second ph- with the icon name.
